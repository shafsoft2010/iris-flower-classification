# üå∏ Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## üìÅ Project Overview
This project is part of **Week 1** of the **NSP Nexus Internship**.  
The goal is to build a simple machine learning model to classify **Iris flowers** into one of three species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

### Dataset:
Classic Iris dataset from sklearn with 150 rows and 4 features.

## Objectives
- Understand basic classification using Machine Learning
- Explore and visualize data
- Train a model using KNN
- Evaluate performance
- Submit via GitHub

## Tools
- Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Results
- Accuracy: ~96.7%
- Minimal misclassifications
- Clear confusion matrix

## Submission
- Notebook: iris_classification.ipynb
